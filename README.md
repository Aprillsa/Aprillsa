- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aprillsa
- 👀 As an ENFJ, my interests are really various.
-  I like
-  singing :microphone:
-  listening to rock music :guitar:
-  playing all kinds of instuments :musical_keyboard:
-  and playing all kinds of sports like frisbee, hiking :tent: ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and PowerBI, because I really love the colorful data world.

During my academic journey in data science, I cultivated proficiency in various programming languages such as Python and C++, allowing me to develop robust software applications and algorithms. Additionally, I've delved into Linux and MATLAB for data analysis, leveraging these platforms to manipulate and derive insights from complex datasets. My exposure to SQL facilitated effective data management and querying, a crucial skill in data-driven environments.

I have hands-on experience in AI and machine learning, having implemented predictive models using frameworks like scikit-learn. These experiences were gained through coursework, personal projects, and collaborative efforts during internships, where I applied machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems, optimizing processes and decision-making.

My exposure to cloud native technologies like AWS has been through coursework and self-directed learning, where I gained insights into building scalable and resilient systems on cloud platforms.

Notably, I've actively sought opportunities to apply these skills beyond academic realms. I collaborated on a team project focusing on embedded software development, where I contributed to designing and implementing software for real-time systems, showcasing my proficiency in C# and electronics.

Moreover, I've been an advocate for agile methodologies, participating in agile-driven projects that emphasized iterative development and adaptability, fostering efficient project management and collaboration within multidisciplinary teams.

- 💞️ I’m looking to find a job in data science domain.
